# MultiplayerPlatformer

Marina Chavarria and I, Joan Ortiga, started this project to show our skills. We want this project to show what we are capable of doing, in a game that implements all kinds of technologies and does it in the right way, fully optimized.

Project is still in early stages.

Code design: [Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_l0eQfQI=/)

Coding rules: [CodePile](https://www.codepile.net/pile/jzQJbNyO)

Trello tasks: [Trello](https://trello.com/b/le0I0iUC)

Current features:
  - **Custom input system**. (We revamped input system to a custom one, so we can better personalize and adapt it better to suit our needs)
  - **Multiplayer system**. (Several players can join the same game. The idea is to connect 1 PC player, with 1 mobile player)
      - Host / Join game system. (Game right now is LAN only. The host generates a key which other player can introduce to join the game).
  - **Playfab implementation**. (Currently playfab records the players' score record and the time played in the game).
  - **Using DOTween** (We implemented DOTween to make fast but customizable animations, and improve animation performance on the UI).
  - **Adaptable Camera** (Customizable camera controller, adapting to any changes we can make in the future.

Game Summary: 
Platform game where the camera infinite scrolls to right. PC player has to keep alive as maximum time, without falling to the void or being eaten by the scrolling. The player of mobile will be in charge of putting platforms to correct place to help the PC player keep suviving. This platforms will have some constrains and rare shapes, to make it difficult, and mobile player will have to select 1 of 3 shapes, and have a cooldown between placing shapes.

For this project we created **UNDEFINED BEHAVIOUR**, a collaboration name for us.

Undefined Behaviour is formed by Marina Chavarria & Joan Ortiga
